# Ideas

Things that are wanted, half-answered, or deliberately postponed. Not a
roadmap and not a promise — a roadmap invites dates, and this is a list of
open questions with what is already known about each, so that picking one up
does not mean re-deriving the investigation behind it.

Anything actually decided lives in `CHANGELOG.md`. Anything actually broken
should be an issue, not an entry here.

## Trail colouring strength by zoom

**Wanted:** tracks that read well at every zoom without touching a slider.

The colouring strength is one number (default 50%) applied at every zoom, and
no single number is right everywhere. At z14 half strength is correct — full
strength drowns the streets underneath. At z10 half strength is too weak: what
is on screen there is mostly long single-pass routes, which the ember ramp
draws dark red, and at half strength over a dark basemap they read as dust.
There is no basemap detail to protect at that zoom anyway.

Measured, on a real archive, at z10: at 50% the routes are muted brick-red; at
100% they are vivid orange with a white core. Same tiles, same fog — only the
multiplier changed.

**The fix, if wanted:** `heatFade()` in `web/src/map.ts` is already a zoom
interpolation, so the strength can rise as the map zooms out — roughly 50% at
z14 through to 100% by z10. A few lines, no re-render, no new setting.

**Two things ruled out with evidence,** so they are not worth revisiting:

- *Fog veiling the trails.* Fog is drawn on top and is 100% cleared along a
  track at z12 and closer, but only 41% at z7 and 65% at z10 — a compelling
  story. Widening the cleared corridor to match the dilated trail changed the
  image almost not at all. Erosion spreads the most-cleared value it can find,
  and at z10 even that is only 65% cleared, so there is nothing fully clear to
  spread.
- *Folding fog by "any child visited ⇒ visited" instead of by averaging.* A
  better-argued idea — "have I been here" is an existence question, not an
  average — and it also changed the image almost not at all.

## Live ingest re-renders the whole day, every time

Found while testing the History tab, and not caused by it. A single Overland
fix reported **284 tiles touched**, because a live source appends to one event
per day: extending the LineString means re-stamping the whole line, so every
new fix costs a render of everything walked so far that day. Early in the day
that is cheap and by evening it is minutes, which is why three test fixes in a
row appeared to hang the server.

Two ways out, neither started:

- **Stamp only the new segment.** The tiles the appended points cover, rather
  than the tiles the whole event covers. Correct and much smaller, but the
  event's raster contribution and its geometry then have to stay in step
  through undo and rebuild, which is the part to get right.
- **Defer it.** A live fix marks tiles pending and returns; the render happens
  on a timer. Cheap to build on the existing pending-render queue, at the cost
  of a fix not appearing on the map immediately.

Worth measuring how long a whole-day render actually takes before choosing -
it is fine at breakfast and the problem is only at the end of a long day.

## Search

Deferred, not dropped. A magnifying glass beside the settings button, expanding
into a search bar.

The 137 GB basemap cannot be searched as it stands: PMTiles holds rendered
vector tiles, so a place name exists as geometry to draw at a zoom rather than
as an index. Answering "where is X" would mean scanning the archive.

Four routes, in the order they were recommended:

1. **Search your own data.** Pins by title, tag, label and folder; tracks by
   name and date. Already in SQLite, no network, no new dependency.
2. **Coordinates and Plus Codes.** Trivial, and useful for a location someone
   sends you.
3. **A local gazetteer.** A one-off extraction of place names out of the
   PMTiles into SQLite FTS5. Hours of processing, names only, but offline.
4. **An external geocoder** such as Nominatim. Argued against: every query
   would leave the machine, which contradicts the premise of the project.

1 + 2 together is the recommendation. Nothing has been chosen.

## Snap drawing to real paths

Wanted as a drawing tool: trace a trail rather than approximate it freehand.

The installed basemap already carries a `roads` layer — confirmed by reading
the archive's own metadata, alongside `boundaries`, `water`, `places` and the
rest — and it is rendered, so `queryRenderedFeatures` can hand back path
geometry under the cursor with **no new data and no new container**. Two
useful levels:

- **Snap** each drawn point onto the nearest path within a few pixels, which
  removes the wobble and puts the line on the trail.
- **Follow one way** from a snapped point along that feature's own geometry to
  the next click, when both land on the same path.

What this cannot do is route across junctions: vector tiles clip geometry at
tile boundaries and carry no topology, so connectivity between segments is not
in there.

## BRouter, or another routing engine

Shelved deliberately, and cheaper than expected if it comes back.

- Segment files are 5°×5°, prebuilt weekly, and the one covering northern
  Italy and Austria is **189 MB** — noise beside a 137 GB basemap. 475 cover
  the world. MIT licensed. No build step; they are downloads.
- A routed line is just a LineString event, so fog clearing and trail drawing
  come free. The integration surface is small.

Against it:

- A third container, and a JVM one, on a stack somebody already had to fight
  through twice.
- A second dataset with its own lifecycle: which segments, downloading them,
  weekly staleness, and "you drew outside your segments". That is a second copy
  of the basemap-download machinery, which took several releases to get right
  the first time.
- It duplicates data already on disk. The basemap holds these paths; vector
  tiles simply discarded the topology routing needs.
- It fights half the use case. Fog-of-war drawing is "I walked this trail" and
  "I walked across this field" in equal measure.
- The tempting shortcut — calling a public routing API — sends where you are
  mapping to a third party, which is the one thing this project exists to
  avoid. Self-hosted or not at all.

Do the snapping above first, and only reach for this if snapping proves
insufficient.

## Places, extended

The Places page works — pins, labels, folders, tags, 30 m fog clearing on drop
— and was always meant to grow past that. What it grows into has not been
decided.

## Colouring visited countries

Asked for, then skipped, and worth recording why: the basemap's `boundaries`
layer carries border **lines**, not country **polygons**. Filling a country
needs an area to fill, and there isn't one in the archive. It would mean
carrying country geometry separately.

## A second workout tracker

The tracker plumbing is behind a registry (`TRACKERS` in
`api/irfaran/trackers.py`) with intervals.icu as the only entry, precisely so
a second one is a client and a settings block rather than a redesign. Nothing
specific is planned.

## Not doing: per-vendor workout API sync

Dropped in favour of the tracker above. Asking one service that already holds
your history beats one integration per vendor.
